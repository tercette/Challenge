Project introdution

The project start with a login page, that connect with the back end microservice and check if the user inserted contains in the database. If yes, back end return a token and the user is allowed to enter in the application. If not, front and show a error message, clear the inputs and push user to enter with the correct credentials. For timing purposes, we set a unique user and password hardcoded in back end. 

To connect into the application, enter this credentials:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90712354/217625913-b7f436e1-519d-4457-8f6a-126dc19481be.png)

	One time the user select a type operation (Credit or Debit) and a value, a "Save" button appears. When clicked, Front end sends a payload using a http call to back end, and this do some important validations and push it to DataBase then return the proper transation and a daily list with all transactions thas is used by the front end to show the operations in the screen.
